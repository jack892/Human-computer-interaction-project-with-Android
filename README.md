# Human-computer-interaction-project-with-Android
A project human-computer interaction made with Android aim to help deaf mute people, with the collaboration of my coworker [Erennio](https://github.com/TimeParadox89).  
This version has the "Speech to gesture" feature,which allows the user to speak through the microphone and showing the corresponding sign language as output on the screen.  
Future feature to be implemented is the function "gesture to speech", the opposite process of the previous feature.
